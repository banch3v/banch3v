## Hi there, I'm Ivelin Banchev (Ivo) üëã

### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About me

I'm a Front-End Developer based in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, passionate about transforming ideas into beautiful realities.

With six years of experience as a low-code WordPress developer and SEO expert, I recognized both the potential of web development and the limitations of the low-code approach. This realization led me to chart a new course to become a front-end developer.

In January 2024, I made a well thought move to quit my full-time job and enroll in the Telerik Academy JavaScript Alpha program. Six months later, I successfully graduated, earning accolades by the trainers for:<br>
‚Ä¢ Being one of the best-performing alumni <br>
‚Ä¢ Best final project: [Telerik Event Calendar](https://telerik-event-calendar.netlify.app/) <br>

Now, I challenge myself daily to expand my knowledge, solve complex problems, and master new technologies.
